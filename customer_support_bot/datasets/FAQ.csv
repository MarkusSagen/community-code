Can I have  multiple input blocks?,"Yes, you can have multiple inputs, e.g., in our Tutorial - Predict California house prices, we use both images and tabular data as input."
Which block should use when I’m designing my model?,It depends on your data and on your task. Check out our cheat sheets for tips and tricks on how to solve your problem.
How many nodes should I have in the last dense block?,"As many as the shape of your target, so it depends on your task."
How do I work with multiple experiments?,Easy experimenting is a key feature of the Peltarion Platform.
How do I use a deployed model?,"First, follow the instructions in the Deployment view part of the Knowledge center."
